## circuits

A programmatic way to design and simulate computational-domain circuits in metapower systems. This is in the spirit of open-source.

### Background

As this is a new foray and we are strapped for resources to _actually_ build the real thing, best we can do is:

1. prove how it _can_ be done
2. publish content on [X](https://twitter.com/cartheur)
3. convince investors
4. demonstrate a clean _real_ and _practical_ green energy future sans silly solar panels and wind turbines
